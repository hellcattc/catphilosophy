Simple Tauri-React app, which implements parsing HTML pages on Rust, getting random cat photos & philosophers quotes, then displaying it on the page with infinite scrolling.

TODO'S 

Saving posts in local storage 

Window navigate buttons(close, etc)

Displaying only unique images & quotes (hard task, involves advanced Rust knowledge (due to complexity of borrow system) which I don't have right now)
