Simple Tauri-React app, which implements parsing HTML pages on Rust, getting random cat photos & philosophers quotes, then displaying it on the page with infinite scrolling.

TODO'S 

Visual changes, only logic is done

Saving posts in local storage 

Window navigate buttons (close, etc)

Displaying only unique images & quotes (hard task, involves advanced Rust knowledge (due to complexity of borrow system) which I don't have right now) spent 30+ hours on this and reverted LOL
